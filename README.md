### Hello Github 👋🏽

My name is Yvan.

My day job is to solve user problems with software 👨🏽‍💻. I like _Azure_, _C#_, _DevOps_ but also _React_, _CSS_ and all things around software architecture. I am always eager to learn new skills and I also like to share what I have learnt.

I wish I could promote more accessibility, diversity and craftmanship.

You can find out here on [Github](https://github.com/yvzn) some of my hobbyist projects, like [Alertegelee.fr](https://github.com/yvzn/frosto), [La recyclette](https://github.com/yvzn/recikligi) and [Tabber](https://github.com/yvzn/tabber), along with experiments with various technologies. You can also find the source code for [my technical blog](https://blog.ludeo.net) (in french).
