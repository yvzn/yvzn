### Hello Github 👋🏽

My name is Yvan.

My day to day job is to solve user problems with software 👨🏽‍💻. I mainly develop in _.NET_ and _C#_ on _Azure_, with extra bits of _React_, _SQL_ and _scripting_. I am always eager to learn new things and I also like to share what I have learnt.

I wish I could promote more craftmanship, accessibility and diversity.

You can find out here on [Github](https://github.com/yvzn) examples of the way I like to code, along with experiments with various technologies. You can also find the source code for my presentations and slides 👨🏽‍🏫.
