### Hello Github 👋🏽

My name is Yvan.

My day job is to solve user problems with software 👨🏽‍💻. I mainly develop in _.NET_ and _C#_ on _Azure_, with extra bits of _React_, _SQL_ and _scripting_. I am always eager to learn new things and I also like to share what I have learnt.

I wish I could promote more craftmanship, accessibility and diversity.

You can find out here on [Github](https://github.com/yvzn) some of my hobbyist projects, like [La recyclette](https://github.com/yvzn/recikligi) and [Tabber](https://github.com/yvzn/tabber), along with experiments with various technologies. You can also find the source code for [my technical blog](https://blog.ludeo.net) (in french).
